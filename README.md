# [2018-05-09] Challenge #360 [Intermediate] Find the Nearest Aeroplane

My attempt at the reddit [/r/dailyprogrammer Challenge #360 Intermediate](https://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/comments/8i5zc3/20180509_challenge_360_intermediate_find_the/) done using Python3

# Usage
Download and ```cd``` into the directory where the ```nearestplane.py``` file is located. Update the function call at the bottom file with the desired coordinates. Then execute the python script by running the following command in the terminal/cmd window:
```python nearestplane.py```
